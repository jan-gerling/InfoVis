# InfoVis

To run visualisation first extract "data/club_transfers_2000-2019.7z"
Then host the InfoVis folder on a server or with the visual studio code extension "Live Server" and go to host/visualisation
When the application is first launched or refreshed it takes a moment to load the json before the graphs appear.
